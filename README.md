## Advanced Potion Making 
NIPS 2017: Defense Against ~~Adversarial Attacks~~ the Dark Arts
 
> “This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, still breathing hard.
“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?”
“Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance.
“This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?”
“Yes,” said Harry firmly.
“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib’ written inside the front cover?”
Harry’s heart missed a beat. “That’s my nickname,” he said.” ― J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

### About 
This repository houses work for the Kaggle NIPS 2017 Adversarial Attack competition. The competition consists of three tasks: 

* Non-targeted Adversarial Attacks: The goal of the non-targeted attack is to slightly modify source image in a way that image will be classified incorrectly by generally unknown machine learning classifier.

* Targeted Adversarial Attacks: The goal of the targeted attack is to slightly modify source image in a way that image will be classified as specified target class by generally unknown machine learning classifier.

* Defense Against ~~Adversarial Attacks~~ the Dark Arts: The goal of the defense is to build machine learning classifier which is robust to adversarial example, i.e. can classify adversarial images correctly.
